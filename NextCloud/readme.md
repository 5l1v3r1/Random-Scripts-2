Simple script I wrote for https://nextcloud.com/, runs on my server and sorts my photos as I drop them into the PhotosToSort directory.

If you encrypt the files at rest this obviously won't work.

Need to install exifread module also https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ExifRead

Warning: This will overwrite a picture if the file name clashes, it's on my todo list to fix that! :)
